Weâ€™ll cover per-vertex coloring, advanced use of vertex arrays, more drawing modes for building 3D models, perspective, textures, and lighting.
This course assumes prior knowledge in WebGL. 
**Note:** Check out [Create 3D Graphics in JavaScript Using WebGL](https://egghead.io/courses/create-3d-graphics-in-javascript-using-webgl) for an in depth introduction to WebGL if some of these concepts are feeling unfamiliar.
